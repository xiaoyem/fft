2.1 The probability of an event is defined to be the fraction of the time the event occurs in a very
    large number of identical trials.

3.1 A random variable is a variable that can take on certain numerical values with certain
    probabilities.

4.1 A probability distribution is the collective information about how the total probability (which
    is always 1) is distributed among the various possible outcomes of the random variable.

4.2 A probability distribution for a continuous random variable is given in terms of a probability
    density. To obtain an actual probability, the density must be multiplied by an interval of the
    random variable. More generally, the probability equals the area under the density curve.

5.1 For a large number of trials, n, a binomial distribution reduces to a Gaussian distribution.

5.2 The law of large numbers states that the measured probability over a large number of trials will
    be essentially equal to the theoretical probability. This law is a consequence of the fact that
    a Gaussian distribution has the property that the larger the number of trials, the thinner the
    distribution's bump, relative to the whole span of possible outcomes.

5.3 In the limit of a large expected number of events, a, a Poisson distribution reduces to a
    Gaussian distribution.

5.4 The central limit theorem says (in its most common form) that if you perform a large number of
    trials of a random process, the probability distribution for the sum (or average) of the
    outcomes is approximately a Gaussian distribution.
